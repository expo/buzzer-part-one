### Setup

- Get the backend running first.
- `cd` into it, run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Open `App.js` and replace `BASE_URL` which the url of your local server (`http://your-network-ip:3000`). Later when you deploy, change it to your production server
- `npm i -g exp` if you don't already have exp or XDE.
- `exp start --ios` or `exp start --android`.
